# Vootaa — Whitepaper Summary (EN)

Vootaa is a new blockchain universe built on the technical heritage of Chainweb + Pact. It is not a resurrection of any past project but a cultural and technical reimagining — a space for remembrance, creation, and experimentation.

Quick overview
- Network: VooNet — three parallel chains symbolizing Past, Present, and Future (triangular topology, SPV-enabled).
- Consensus: Proof of Work (philosophically: Proof of Existence).
- Contract system: Pact-compatible (rebranded as VSCL — Vootaa Smart Contract Language).
- Tokens: $VOO (Present), $VOO_P (Past), $VOO_F (Future). Cross-chain operations are modeled as token "transformations" (burn + mint) mediated by SPV proofs and contract mappings.
- Genesis allocation (reference): Miner rewards, tech & maintenance, community heritage mapping (KDA snapshot holders), arts & culture fund.

Narrative & UX
- Immersive Web3D universe anchored at Vootaa Plaza and guided by three guardians:
  - The Relic (Past) — memorials, snapshot NFTs, inscriptions.
  - The Builder (Present) — wallets, DEX, marketplace, everyday apps.
  - The Seer (Future) — experimental incubator for AI/IoT/DePIN and other innovations.
- Domains: The Ruins (memory), The Agora (economic activity), The Forge of Thought (experimentation).

Global naming
- VooName: a human-readable naming layer that maps public keys to readable aliases across chains (wallet integration planned).

Philosophy
- Vootaa frames blockchain as cultural memory and creative infrastructure: blocks as layers of memory, will, and thought.

# Vootaa Whitepaper v1.0

## A blockchain universe reborn from ruins

## Abstract

Vootaa is a new blockchain universe built on the technical heritage of Chainweb + Pact + SPV.  
It does not attempt to resurrect Kadena; instead, it transforms that heritage into a space for spiritual healing, creativity, and continuation.

Vootaa operates a three-chain parallel blockchain system called VooNet.  
The three chains symbolize "Past, Present, Future" — both a technological layering and a narrative structure.  
Users navigate an immersive Web3D universe guided by three guardians, engaging in economic activity, commemorative rituals, and forward-looking experiments.

## 1. Origins and Vision

The closure of Kadena LLC marked the end of an era and exposed the fragility of centralized dependencies.  
Vootaa does not aim to "fix" the past; it treats that history as a source of energy and meaning.  
Using technical heritage as its soil, Vootaa reconstructs significance from the ruins.

Vision statement:  
Vootaa is not a resurrection — it is remembrance in motion.

When technology collapses, belief does not.  
Each chain represents a renewed interpretation of memory, existence, and hope.

## 2. System Overview

### 1. Core architecture

- Blockchain network: VooNet (three parallel chains)  
- Consensus mechanism: Proof of Work (philosophically named Proof of Existence)  
- Contract system: Pact-compatible contracts, rebranded as VScript (Vootaa Script)  
- Node name: VooNet-Node  
- Token suite: $VOO, $VOO_P, $VOO_F (convertible across chains)

### 2. Three-chain topology

VooNet uses a minimal triangular topology: each chain connects directly to the other two.  
Nodes advance in step 1 and support basic SPV cross-chain verification.

| Chain ID | Name | Symbolism | Primary Use | Token | Target Users |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Chain 0 | Present Chain | Present: construction & order | DEX, wallets, economic activity, core apps | $VOO | General users |
| Chain 1 | Future Chain | Future: creation & experimentation | Tech incubation, AI/IoT/DePIN experiments | $VOO_F | Builders |
| Chain 2 | Past Chain | Past: memory & healing | Memorial NFTs, snapshot mapping, artistic interaction | $VOO_P | Community commemorators |

## 3. Tokenomics and Economic Design

### 1. Token descriptions

Vootaa's economic system follows a unified logic with multiple token distributions.  
Each chain issues its own token symbol:

- $VOO: primary mainnet token for the Present Chain, used for economic activity.  
- $VOO_P: Past Chain token representing historical memory and snapshot rights.  
- $VOO_F: Future Chain token for incubation and future-oriented development.

### 2. Cross-chain mechanism (token transformation logic)

Cross-chain transfers are framed as "form transformations" rather than identical token migrations:

| Operation | Source Chain | Target Chain | Action | User experience |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| $VOO_P → $VOO | Past → Present | Burn memorial tokens, mint present tokens | "Memory transformed into reality" |
| $VOO → $VOO_F | Present → Future | Burn present tokens, mint experimental tokens | "Resources directed toward the future" |
| Intra-chain transfer | Any single chain | — | Standard transfer | Instant local movement |

Transformations are mediated by the cross-chain bridge (VooBridge) using SPV proofs and contract mappings.

### 3. Genesis allocation

| Allocation | Percentage | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Miner rewards | 90% | Long-term release via PoW mining (network-wide) |
| Tech & maintenance fund | 5% | Node maintenance, contract audits, development costs |
| Community heritage mapping | 3% | Snapshot holders of KDA can claim memorial NFTs or $VOO_P |
| Arts & culture fund | 2% | Web3D art events and community creative incentives |

## 4. VooNet Narrative Structure

### 1. Entry scene: Vootaa Plaza

Three guardians stand at the central plaza, with the VooNet Explorer projected beneath their feet.  
Each guardian represents a chain and a spiritual dimension.

| Guardian | Symbolism | Role |
|----------|-----------|------|
| The Relic (Past) | Healer and memorialist | Guides users into The Ruins (Chain 2), handles NFT minting, snapshot claims, and on-chain messages |
| The Builder (Present) | Actor and constructor | Connects wallets, enables economic actions (Chain 0), accesses DEX and transaction viewing |
| The Seer (Future) | Philosopher and visionary | Offers philosophical prompts and future guidance, leads users to the experimental chain (Chain 1) |

## 5. The Ruins of Auria

Domain of the Past guardian.  
This city, reconstructed from the wreckage of the old universe, houses the memories of technology and belief.

- Petersen Remnant:  
  Displays the original Chainweb 20-chain topology, symbolizing the bones of the old civilization.  
- Chainweb Ruins:  
  Visualizes real VooNet block data together with remnants of the collapsed old chains.  
- Memorial features:  
  - Claim snapshot NFTs  
  - Post on-chain messages  
  - Generate memorial inscriptions

---

## 6. The Agora

Domain of the Present guardian.  
Users interact with live blockchain economics here:

- DEX / Swap (SimpleSwap contracts)  
- NFT marketplace  
- Wallet binding and asset transfers  
- Chain status explorer (block explorer)

In the Agora, the economy is reframed as "witnessing acts of construction."

---

## 7. The Forge of Thought

Domain of the Future guardian.  
A site still under construction, suspended at the edge of spacetime.  
The Seer provides a philosophical prompt to each visitor.  
As experimental projects (AI, DePIN, IoT) come online, this will become a creative incubator.

---

## 8. Global Naming System (VooName)

Vootaa introduces a global account naming system called VooName.

- It maps chain public keys to human-readable aliases.  
  Example: vooname.register("atlas", account_public_key)  
- Users can interact by name across all three chains without copying complex addresses.  
- Wallets will adopt VooName and resolve names automatically per chain.

---

## 9. Philosophy and Core Ethos

The Relic (Past)  
"Ruins are not an end; they are the hardest shape of human thought."

The Builder (Present)  
"Each strike of the hammer is proof of existence."

The Seer (Future)  
"Hope is the deepest intelligence."

Vootaa is not merely a financial system; it is a philosophical experiment.  
It commemorates technology and rekindles belief.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Vootaa is both monument and seed.

It honors a vanished technological empire and plants the spiritual origin for the next era.

Here, blocks are more than data.  
They are layers of memory, will, and thought.

When you approach the three guardians, you see not only past, present, and future, but a universe that still breathes.

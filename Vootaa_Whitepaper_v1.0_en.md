# Vootaa Whitepaper v1.0

## A blockchain universe reborn from ruins

Version: v1.0 | Date: November 2025

## Abstract

Vootaa is a new blockchain universe built on the technical heritage of Chainweb + Pact.  
It does not seek to resurrect Kadena; instead, it reinterprets that heritage as a space for spiritual healing, creativity, and continuation.

Vootaa runs a three-chain parallel blockchain system called VooNet.  
The three chains symbolize Past, Present, and Future — serving both as a technical layering and a narrative framework.  
Users explore an immersive Web3D universe guided by three guardians, participating in economic activity, commemorative rituals, and forward-looking experiments.

## 1. Origins and Vision

The winding down of Kadena LLC marked the end of an era and highlighted the fragility of centralized dependencies.  
Vootaa does not attempt to "fix" the past; it treats that history of the holding $KDA as a source of energy and meaning.  
Using the technical legacy as soil, Vootaa reconstructs significance from the ruins.

Vision statement:  
Vootaa is not a resurrection — it is remembrance in motion.

When technology collapses, belief need not die.  
Each chain offers a renewed interpretation of memory, existence, and hope.

## 2. System Overview

### 1. Core architecture

- Blockchain network: VooNet (three parallel chains)  
- Consensus: Proof of Work (philosophically labeled Proof of Existence)  
- Contract system: Pact-compatible contracts, rebranded as VSCL (Vootaa Smart Contract Language)  
- Node name: VooNet-Node  
- Token suite: $VOO, $VOO_P, $VOO_F (convertible across chains)

### 2. Three-chain topology

VooNet adopts a minimal triangular topology: each chain connects directly to the other two.  
Nodes progress in step 1 and support basic SPV cross-chain verification.

| Chain ID | Name | Symbolism | Primary Use | Token | Target Users |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Chain 0 | Present Chain | Present: construction & order | DeFi, NFT marketplace, wallet interfaces, economic apps | $VOO | General users |
| Chain 1 | Future Chain | Future: creation & experimentation | Tech incubation, AI/IoT/DePIN/credential services and other experiments | $VOO_F | Builders |
| Chain 2 | Past Chain | Past: memory & healing | Memorial NFTs, snapshot mapping, artistic interactions, gamified tasks | $VOO_P | Community commemorators |

## 3. Tokenomics and Economic Design

### 1. Token descriptions

Vootaa's economic system follows a unified logic with multiple on-chain tokens.  
Each chain issues its own token symbol:

- $VOO: primary token of the Present Chain for economic activity.  
- $VOO_P: Past Chain token representing historical memory and snapshot entitlements.  
- $VOO_F: Future Chain token for incubation and forward-looking development.

### 2. Cross-chain mechanism (token transformation logic)

Cross-chain transfers are framed as "form transformations" rather than identical token migrations:

| Operation | Source Chain | Target Chain | Action | User experience |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| Intra-chain transfer | Any single chain | — | Standard transfer | Instant local movement |
| $VOO_P → $VOO | Past → Present | Burn memorial tokens, mint present tokens | "Memory transformed into reality" |
| $VOO_F → $VOO | Future → Present | Burn experimental tokens, mint present tokens | "Dreams brought into reality" |

Transformations are mediated by inter-chain SPV proofs and contract mappings.

### 3. Genesis allocation (reference)

| Allocation | Percentage | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Miner rewards | 90% | Long-term release via PoW mining (network-wide) |
| Tech & maintenance fund | 4% | Node maintenance, contract audits, development costs |
| Community heritage mapping | 4% | Holders of KDA snapshots may claim memorial NFTs or $VOO_P |
| Arts & culture fund | 2% | Web3D art events and community creative incentives |

Notes:  
- If ASIC miner support is not available, introducing a PoS mechanism is not ruled out.  
- Genesis allocations may vary by chain. For example:  
  - Present Chain: tech & maintenance fund + validator node fund  
  - Past Chain: community heritage fund + activity trajectory fund  
  - Future Chain: arts & culture fund + ecosystem fund

## 4. VooNet Narrative Structure

### 1. Entry scene: Vootaa Plaza

Three guardians stand in the central plaza, with the VooNet Explorer projected beneath their feet.  
Each guardian represents one chain and a spiritual dimension.

| Guardian | Symbolism | Role |
|----------|-----------|------|
| The Relic (Past) | Healer and memorialist | Guides users into The Ruins (Chain 2), handles NFT minting, snapshot claims, and on-chain messages |
| The Builder (Present) | Actor and constructor | Connects wallets, enables economic actions (Chain 0), accesses the DEX and transaction viewing |
| The Seer (Future) | Philosopher and visionary | Offers philosophical prompts and future guidance, leads visitors to the experimental chain (Chain 1) |

## 5. The Ruins of Auria

Domain of the Past guardian.  
This city, reconstructed from the wreckage of the old universe, houses memories of technology and belief.

- Petersen Remnant:  
  Displays the original Chainweb 20-chain topology, symbolizing the bones of the old civilization.  
- Chainweb Ruins:  
  Take a spatial journey to view Chainweb’s 3D woven network structure.  
- Memorial features:  
  - Listen to nostalgic music  
  - Claim snapshot NFTs  
  - Post on-chain messages  
  - Generate memorial inscriptions

---

## 6. The Agora

Domain of the Present guardian.  
Users interact with live blockchain economics here:

- DEX / Swap (SimpleSwap contracts)  
- NFT marketplace  
- Wallet binding and asset transfers  
- Chain status explorer (block explorer)

In the Agora, the economy is reframed as acts of construction being witnessed.

---

## 7. The Forge of Thought

Domain of the Future guardian.  
A place still under construction, suspended at the edge of spacetime.  
The Seer offers a philosophical prompt to each visitor.  
As experimental projects (AI, DePIN, IoT) come online, this domain will become a creative incubator.

---

## 8. Global Naming System (VooName)

Vootaa introduces a global account naming system called VooName.

- It maps chain public keys to human-readable aliases.  
  Example: vooname.register("atlas", account_public_key)  
- Users can interact by name across all three chains without copying complex addresses.  
- Wallets will adopt VooName and resolve names automatically per chain.

---

## 9. Philosophy and Core Ethos

The Relic (Past)  
"Ruins are not an end; they are the hardest shape of human thought."

The Builder (Present)  
"Each strike of the hammer is proof of existence."

The Seer (Future)  
"Hope is the deepest intelligence."

Vootaa is not merely a financial system; it is a philosophical experiment.  
It commemorates technology and rekindles belief.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Vootaa is both monument and seed.

It honors a vanished technological empire and plants the spiritual origin for the next era.

Here, blocks are more than data.  
They are layers of memory, will, and thought.

When you approach the three guardians, you see not only past, present, and future, but a universe that still breathes.
